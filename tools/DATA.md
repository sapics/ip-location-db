### autonomous_system_number

`autonomous_system_number` is a unique number assigned to an Autonomous System (AS) by the [IANA](https://www.iana.org/). [wiki](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)).

--- ${field-explanation-country_code} ---
### country_code

`country_code` is the two-letter code defined in [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2).
You can get the `country name, capital, continent, currency, languages, etc.` from the `country_code` by [Countries Database](https://github.com/annexare/Countries) in JSON, CSV, SQL format.

--- ${format-country-csv} ---
```CSV
ip_range_start, ip_range_end, country_code
```

--- ${format-country-mmdb} ---
```
country_code
```

--- ${format-asn-csv} ---
```CSV
ip_range_start, ip_range_end, autonomous_system_number, autonomous_system_organization
```

--- ${format-asn-mmdb} ---
```
autonomous_system_number, autonomous_system_organization
```

--- ${format-city-csv} ---
```CSV
ip_range_start, ip_range_end, country_code, city, state1, state2, postcode, latitude, longitude, timezone
```

--- ${format-city-mmdb} ---
```
country_code, city, state1, state2, postcode, latitude, longitude, timezone
```

--- ${explanation-country} ---
These databases map IP ranges to country codes.
--- ${explanation-asn} ---
These databases map IP ranges to [Autonomous System Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_%28Internet%29) (ASN) details. An ASN is a unique number assigned to an Autonomous System (AS) by the [IANA](https://www.iana.org/).
--- ${explanation-city} ---
These databases map IP ranges to more fine-grained location information.

--- ${format-explanation-country} ---
### CSV format

${format-explanation-country-csv}

### MMDB format

${format-explanation-country-mmdb}

--- ${format-explanation-country-csv} ---
The `country` CSV files all share the same format:

```CSV
ip_range_start, ip_range_end, country_code
```

#### IP address format

${format-explanation-ip-range}

#### Country code

The `country_code` is the two-letter code defined in [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2). You can get additional data such as the `country_name`, `capital`, `continent`, `currency`, `languages`, etc. by joining the `country_code` to the [Countries Database](https://github.com/annexare/Countries) which is available in JSON, CSV, SQL formats.
--- ${format-explanation-country-mmdb} ---
The IP ranges in MMDB files are handled within a special field and so are not included in the field list, but other fields are included in a "flat" structure:

```
country_code
```

--- ${format-explanation-asn} ---
### CSV format

${format-explanation-asn-csv}

### MMDB format

${format-explanation-asn-mmdb}
--- ${format-explanation-asn-csv} ---
The `asn` CSV files all share the same format:

```CSV
ip_range_start, ip_range_end, autonomous_system_number, autonomous_system_organization
```

#### IP address format

${format-explanation-ip-range}

#### Number

The `autonomous_system_number` is the numeric code for the specific Autonomous System.

#### Organisation

The `autonomous_system_organization` is the name for the specific Autonomous System.
--- ${format-explanation-asn-mmdb} ---
The IP ranges in MMDB files are handled within a special field and so are not included in the field list, but other fields are included in a "flat" structure:

```
autonomous_system_number
autonomous_system_organization
```
--- ${format-explanation-city} ---
### CSV format

${format-explanation-city-csv}

### MMDB format

${format-explanation-city-mmdb}
--- ${format-explanation-city-csv} ---
The `city` CSV files all share the same format:

```CSV
ip_range_start, ip_range_end, country_code, state1, state2, city, postcode, latitude, longitude, timezone
```

#### IP address format

${format-explanation-ip-range}

#### Country code

The `country_code` is the two-letter code defined in [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2). You can get additional data such as the `country_name`, `capital`, `continent`, `currency`, `languages`, etc. by joining the `country_code` to the [Countries Database](https://github.com/annexare/Countries) which is available in JSON, CSV, SQL formats.
--- ${format-explanation-city-mmdb} ---
The IP ranges in MMDB files are handled within a special field and so are not included in the field list, but other fields are included in a "flat" structure:

```
city
country_code
state1
state2
postcode
latitude
longitude
timezone
```

#### Latitude and longitude

The `longitude` and `latitude` fields are saved as `string` types because the MMDB files do not allow `null` values for `float` types *(and `0,0` are valid coordinates)*.

### Optional fields

Apart from the IP information and the `country_code` field, all other fields are optional and will only be populated if the datasource contained them.

--- ${format-explanation-ip-range} ---
`ip_range_start` and `ip_range_end` are either IP addresses, or IP addresses in numeric format *(depending upon which files you choose)* and these two fields represent an **inclusive** range of IP addresses for that data row.

For example, in the `-ipv4.csv` files, the CSV line: `1.0.0.0,1.0.0.255,AU` would mean that any IP addresses between `1.0.0.0` and `1.0.0.255` *(inclusive)* are `AU`. In `-ipv4-num.csv` files, the equivalent line would be: `16777216,16777471,AU`.

For example, in the `-ipv6.csv` files, the CSV line: `2001:200::,2001:200:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff,JP` would mean that any IP addresses between `2001:200::` and `2001:200:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff` *(inclusive)* are `JP`. In `-ipv6-num.csv` files, the equivalent line would be: `42540528726795050063891204319802818560,42540528806023212578155541913346768895,JP`.

Please be careful when using IPv6 and IPv6-num files in your program, the numerical value exceeds 32bit unsigned integers, and you would need to use a 128bit unsigned integer.

## Merge rule for multiple database

When merging multiple database, set the front database above back one.
For example, geo-whois-asn-country is created by merging 3 database with GeoFeed > Whois > ASN.
In more detail, the geo-whois-asn database matches the GeoFeed results, for ip ranges not covered by GeoFeed it matches the Whois results, and for ip ranges not covered by either it matches the ASN results.
```
GeoFeed: 1.0.0.0, 2.0.0.0, AU
         3.0.0.1, 4.0.0.0, US
Whois:   1.0.0.0, 2.2.0.0, FR
         2.5.0.1, 4.0.0.0, IN
ASN:     1.0.0.0, 4.0.0.0, JP
```
is converted to
```
GeoFeed-Whois-ASN: 1.0.0.0, 2.0.0.0, AU
                   2.0.0.1, 2.2.0.0, FR
                   2.2.0.1, 2.5.0.0, JP
                   2.5.0.1, 3.0.0.0, IN
