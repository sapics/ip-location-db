# ip-location-db

This project provides IP to location databases in CSV and MMDB formats.

There are 3 types of IP database in this repository: `country`, `city` and `asn` files. All have their own standard format.

### Country

${format-country-csv}

${download-table-header}
${download-table-asn-country}
${download-table-geo-asn-country}
${download-table-geo-whois-asn-country}
${download-table-iptoasn-country}
${download-table-iplocate-country}
${download-table-dbip-country}
${download-table-dbip-geo-whois-asn-country}
${download-table-geolite2-country}
${download-table-geolite2-geo-whois-asn-country}

### City

${format-city-csv}

${download-table-header}
${download-table-dbip-city}
${download-table-geolite2-city}


### ASN

${format-asn-csv}

${download-table-header}
${download-table-asn}
${download-table-iptoasn-asn}
${download-table-iplocate-asn}
${download-table-dbip-asn}
${download-table-geolite2-asn}


## File formats

An explanation of each file format is provided in its own directory.

All files of a given type share the same file format; for example, you could swap one `asn` file for any other `asn` file.

## Which database should I use?

It depends upon your use-case! We do have some simple recommendations though:

- If you need postcodes or timezones: `geolite2-city`
- If you need city data with a CC-BY Licence: `dbip-city`
- If you need a country database with a Public Domain Licence: `geo-whois-asn-country`
- If you need a high accuracy and wide IP range country database: `geolite2-geo-whois-asn-country` which is equivalent to `geolite2-country` for `geolite2-country` covered IP range and `geo-whois-asn-country` for the other IP range. (0.10% wider for IPv4 and 2.34% wider for IPv6 than `geolite2-country` at Aug. 2024)
- If you need an ASN database: `asn`


## Accuracy of database

Since there is no definitive information on IP addresses and country_code, it is difficult to discuss the accuracy of Public Domain data qualitatively, but it is possible to estimate the approximate accuracy by comparing it with the country information in GeoLite2 and DbIp Lite.
By comparing the database in GeoLite2, which is well known for its high accuracy, with the differences in other databases, we can see that Public Domain accuracy.

| Database | Same | Diff | Empty | Extra |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| dbip-country | 96.15% | 3.85% | 0.00% | 0.42% |
| asn-country | 95.97% | 4.00% | 0.03% | 0.03% |
| geo-asn-country | 97.26% | 2.71% | 0.03% | 0.06% |
| geo-whois-asn-country | 96.98% | 2.99% | 0.03% | 0.12% |
| iptoasn-country | 76.80% | 4.99% | 18.21% | 1.26% |

Measurements were taken in 9 Oct. 2024.
Because the ipv6 range is too wide, the measurements here are limited to ipv4 results.
"Same" + "Diff" + "Empty" shows the GeoLite2 IP-range, and the GeoLite2 IP-range size is listed as 100%.

- "Same" indicates the percentage of country_codes in Database that are the same as the country_code in GeoLite2.
- "Diff" indicates the percentage of country_codes in Database that are different from GeoLite2 country_code.
- "Empty" shows the percentage of IPs with GeoLite2 country_code but no corresponding country_code in Database.
- "Extra" indicates the percentage of IPs with no GeoLite2 country_code listed that had a country_code listed in the Database.


We can see that for all data except iptoasn-country, the country_code matches the GeoLite2 results in more than 96% of cases.
Although there is some variation in the results due to differences in update timing and the priority of the information, we believe that the Public Domain data shows a certain level of accuracy.


## MMDB Libraries

If you would like to integrate MMDB files into an existing project there are several libraries that can help.


### Read MMDB files

Libraries exist in many languages when using the MMDB files. There are official, [Maxmind developed libraries](https://github.com/maxmind) for many popular languages: [.NET](https://github.com/maxmind/MaxMind-DB-Reader-dotnet), [C](https://github.com/maxmind/libmaxminddb), [Node.js](https://github.com/maxmind/GeoIP2-node), [Perl](https://github.com/maxmind/MaxMind-DB-Reader-perl), [PHP](https://github.com/maxmind/MaxMind-DB-Reader-php), [Python](https://github.com/maxmind/MaxMind-DB-Reader-python) and [Ruby](https://github.com/maxmind/MaxMind-DB-Reader-ruby), and third-party readers for others: [Erlang](https://github.com/g-andrade/locus), [Go](https://github.com/oschwald/maxminddb-golang), [Rust](https://github.com/oschwald/maxminddb-rust).


### Write MMDB files

If you wish to create your own MMDB files from the CSV files *(to customise their format)* there are a couple of official libraries: [Go](https://github.com/maxmind/mmdbwriter) and [Perl](https://github.com/maxmind/MaxMind-DB-Writer-perl) *(now archived)*. There are also some third-party options: [Python](https://github.com/VimT/MaxMind-DB-Writer-python) and [Rust](https://github.com/pierd/maxminddb-writer).
