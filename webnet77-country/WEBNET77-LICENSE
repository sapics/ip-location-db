This database is "DONATIONWARE"
===============================

It's simple: we cannot offer tens of thousands of downloads per day without
assistance. Please help us.... the PayPal link is near the top right of the
page here: http://software77.net/geo-ip/

If you use the database in a commercial application and therefore benefit
financially we ask you to to make a small donation.

If this database is anywhere half decent, pay what it's worth to you, as a
developer or an end user.

Our IPToCountry database is now part of many Linux and even WINDOWS
distributions/packages. In other words, it comes included with the sofware
the end user purchases and the end user is usually totally oblivious to this.

It may be invisible to the user. S/he may not even know they have it on their
PC, MAC, Tablet, Cellphone or other device; but be assured, this database
is pervasive, and is to be found on many devices across the planet.
As a tiny (truly tiny) company, we cannot support the world.

We appeal to developers to make mention of the fact that this database
is DONATIONWARE; many end user applications download the database weekly
or even daily as part of the application and the end user is not even aware
of the fact that they are making use of a resource entirely for free.

HELP US! ... and make a small donation. And if you are a developer, make it
known to your end users. Please.
