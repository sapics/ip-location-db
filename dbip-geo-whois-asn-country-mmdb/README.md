## Merge rule for multiple database

When merging multiple database, set the front database above back one.
For example, geo-whois-asn-country is created by merging 3 database with GeoFeed > Whois > ASN.
In more detail, the geo-whois-asn database matches the GeoFeed results, for ip ranges not covered by GeoFeed it matches the Whois results, and for ip ranges not covered by either it matches the ASN results.
```
GeoFeed: 1.0.0.0, 2.0.0.0, AU
         3.0.0.1, 4.0.0.0, US
Whois:   1.0.0.0, 2.2.0.0, FR
         2.5.0.1, 4.0.0.0, IN
ASN:     1.0.0.0, 4.0.0.0, JP
```
is converted to
```
GeoFeed-Whois-ASN: 1.0.0.0, 2.0.0.0, AU
                   2.0.0.1, 2.2.0.0, FR
                   2.2.0.1, 2.5.0.0, JP
                   2.5.0.1, 3.0.0.0, IN
                   3.0.0.1, 4.0.0.0, US
