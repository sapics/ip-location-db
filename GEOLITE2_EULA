GeoLite2 End User License Agreement
Revised on December 7, 2020

MaxMind, Inc. ("MaxMind"), a Delaware Corporation, offers a line of free databases that provide geographic information and other data associated with specific IP addresses (each a "GeoLite2 Database" and collectively the "GeoLite2 Databases"). MaxMind also offers a free service that provides geographic and other data associated with a specific IP address (each a "GeoLite2 Web Service" and collectively the "GeoLite2 Web Services"). The data available through the GeoLite2 Databases and the GeoLite2 Web Services is referred to in this Agreement as the "GeoLite2 Data". The term "Services" as used in this Agreement means the Geolite2 Databases, the GeoLite2 Web Services and the GeoLite2 Data. "Website" refers to MaxMind's website, www.maxmind.com.

  MaxMind Privacy Policy ("PP")

This Agreement controls in the event of any conflict with the above-referenced documents, except as otherwise provided in Section 7 (Personal Data). Thereafter, for any conflicts among the above 4 documents, the priority and precedence of interpretation is DPA, PP, WT and Creative Commons License.

4. NO USE OF GEOLITE2 DATA FOR FCRA PURPOSES.

The parties understand and agree that MaxMind is not a consumer reporting agency as defined by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. §1681 et seq. ("FCRA"), and that the Services do not constitute "consumer reports" as defined in the FCRA. You understand that any information you provide to MaxMind in order to use the Services has not been collected by MaxMind for credit purposes and is not intended to be indicative of any consumer's credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, or other characteristics listed in Section 603(d) of the FCRA.

5. ACCURACY EXPECTATION: NO USE OF GEOLITE2 DATA FOR IDENTIFYING SPECIFIC HOUSEHOLDS OR INDIVIDUALS.

Due to the nature of geolocation technology and other factors beyond its control, MaxMind cannot and does not guarantee the accuracy of the GeoLite2 Data. The Services contain only the geographic data available and the availability of such data is not consistent for all regions. Furthermore, none of the Services reliably identifies any geographic level or division more precise than the zip code or postal code associated with an IP address. Accordingly, it is imperative that you and your end users not rely on the GeoLite2 Data to identify a specific household, individual, or street address. You acknowledge the foregoing limitation of the GeoLite2 Data and agree represent and warrant that you will not use or encourage others to use the GeoLite2 Data for the purpose of identifying or locating a specific household, individual, or street address.

In the event you discover a data incident involving the Services, you shall promptly notify MaxMind and fully cooperate with MaxMind, at your own expense, in remediating the incident.

The parties hereby agree to and incorporate by reference the DPA, which shall apply to the extent the parties process any Personal Information (as defined in the DPA) in connection with your use of the Services.
